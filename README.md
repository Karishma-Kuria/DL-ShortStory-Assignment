### DL Short Story Assignment on: Optimized U-Net for Brain Tumor Segmentation 
### In the field of Medical Image Processing, automatic brain tumor segmentation is one of the most strenuous problem. U-Net and Fully Convolutional networks are the commonly used architectures. Applications includes anatomical segmentation of cardiac CT, detection of lung nodules in chest CT etc.

### Our study consists of extensive experiment to study an optimal U-Net variant and training schedule for BraTS dataset. We have used 5 U-Net variants: Basic U-Net, Residual U-Net, SegResNetVAE, Attention U-Net and UNETR model. Various experiments are done with different loss function, Deep supervision. Model is further optimized by changing the depth of the encoder, increasing number of convolutional filters and using one-hot encoder channels.
